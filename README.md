## Problem Statement

* There are several million species of plants & animals present in nature around us, but only a few million have been discovered and recognized.
* Each plant and animal has different characteristic features and can be grouped into some level of a taxonomic group.
* There are numerous resources on the web to learn about them. However, there does not exist a platform which provides us with all the information in one place, from the basic details to new and ongoing research.
* We aim to classify the sub-species of the taxonomy by mapping it with existing databases and retrieve information about them from relevant data warehouses using our in-house APIs.
